Switching:- TO connect system A to B we connect them to switch thats ways switch create nw that connect each other.
            To connect each other we need interface(eth) on each other.
            |ip link| command to see interfaces
            If these are in NW 192.168.1.0 we assign both machines IP address.
            |ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0| and |ip addr add 192.168.1.11/24 dev eth0|

Note:- Switch only enable communication bw hosts within same NW.


## Now suppose we want to communicate systems in other NW 192.168.2.0. Than how system in one system communicate with system in other NW.

Routing:- Thats where router comes in to connect two diff NW's. Its having port connected from both nw and assignes
            ip as say 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1. we need to configure gateway to comm bw one NW to another.
            |route| command to see the gateway and destinations.
            |ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.1| (To send packet in 192.168.1.0/24 NW via 192.168.2.1)
            |ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1|
            To connect to internet world we use |ip route add default via 192.168.1.2| or in place of default 0.0.0.0

To enable port forwarding we have to set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward = 1
