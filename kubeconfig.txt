Organizing Cluster Access Using kubeconfig Files

Use kubeconfig files to organize information about clusters, users, namespaces, and authentication mechanisms. The kubectl command-line tool uses kubeconfig files to find the information it needs to choose a cluster and communicate with the API server of a cluster.

By default, kubectl looks for a file named config in the $HOME/.kube directory. You can specify other kubeconfig files by setting the KUBECONFIG environment variable or by setting the --kubeconfig flag.


# kubectl config use-context <user>@<cluster>  (to change the current validating user for cluster set up in context)
# kubectl config view (to see current config set)
# kubectl config view --kubeconfig=my-custom-config-file  (One can create and mark that file here to used)
