## Back Up, Restore and Migrate Kubernetes with Velero
Originally developed by Heptio and known as Ark, Velero is supported by Dellâ€™s PowerProtect, allowing PowerProtect 
users to back up their Kubernetes clusters.
Velero is a command-line tool that backs up clusters and restores them in case of loss, migrates cluster resources
to other clusters, and replicates a production cluster to development and testing clusters.

1. Backing up of Resource configuration
2. ETCD cluster
3. Persistent volumes


1. kubectl get all --all-namespcaes -o yaml > backup.yaml

2. While backing ETCD cluster you can check the volume mount point for its certs /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd
    as well as data /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd under its pod definition file.
    --data-dir=/var/lib/etcd

    OR

    We have inbuilt restore taking mechanism via ETCDCTL_API=3
    -> ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save snapshotdb  -- Taking snapshot
    -> ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot status snapshotdb  -- see status

Restore==
    ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore snapshot.db \
  --name m1 \
  --initial-cluster m1=http://host1:2380,m2=http://host2:2380,m3=http://host3:2380 \
  --initial-cluster-token etcd-cluster-1 \
  --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://host1:2380

  Next, start etcd with the new data directories

  etcd \
  --name m1 \
  --listen-client-urls http://host1:2379 \
  --advertise-client-urls http://host1:2379 \
  --listen-peer-urls http://host1:2380 &


--> etcd --version, kubectl logs etcd-master -n kube-system 


Ques. The master nodes in our cluster are planned for a regular maintenance reboot tonight. While we do not 
anticipate anything to go wrong, we are required to take the necessary backups. Take a snapshot of the ETCD
database using the built-in snapshot functionality.
Store the backup file at location /tmp/snapshot-pre-boot.db
