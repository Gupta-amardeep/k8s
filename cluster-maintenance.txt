## Cluster maintenance

Note:- Cloud provider will itself upgrade the OS, K8s version for its K8s service

1. Operating system upgrade:-

-> kubectl drain node01 (It will terminate the node and mark it as unschedulable but pods that are not in replicaset 
get evicted and pods related to replicaset will itself create replication other node)

Note:- It you stop the node without draining it, the pods that are in replicaset will itself create
       but the non-replicaset will get evicted from it. There is parameter --pod-eviction-timeout=5min
       that will try to restart the pods on it if node is coming back in 5 min otherwise it will mark the
       node as dead.

-> Kubectl uncordon node01 (Once the node is back we will make the node uncordon that is again schedulable for
    pods but remember no pod will comeback again we have to schedule it )

-> kubectl cordon node02 (It will make node unschedulable for new pods but does not terminate it or remove the
    pods which are running on it)


Note:- kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets (for pods scheduled as daemonsets u have to do it)
       kubectl drain node02 --force (If pod is not part of replicaset it will permanently remove it)


## K8s release version - Major.Minor.Patch = v1.16.0
The new  version will all control plane components like api-server, controller-manger, scheduler, kubelet, proxy
kubectl apart from etcd and coredns that does not follow this.
Note:- the other components should never be of higher version than kubeapi-server. Also the controller and scheduler
    can be on X,X-1, kubelet & kube-proxy on X,X-1,X-2 AND KUBECTL CAN BE x-1,x,x+1

NOTE:- Always upgrade minor version one by one. We cannot jump to 1.16 from 1.13 instead first 1.14,1.15 than 1.16

1.  Upgrade the master node (api,controller,scheduler go down that does not mean your pod wont run. just  u wont 
    able to schedule new pods also u wont be able to use kubectl utility as well)
2. Upgrade the worker nodes (Three strategies are there 
                            a. All nodes down - no appln is availaible to serve user
                            b. One node at a time - (ideal for Replicaset)
                            c. Add new node to cluster with new version and than perform upgrade one at a time)


Kubeadm upgrade plan:-
1. kubeadm upgrade plan (It will show u kubeadm version, cluster version and all componets version, latest
                        stable version availaible and at wht version we have to manually upgrade kubelet)
##Master
a. apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00 --allow-unauthenticated (upgrade kubeadm)
b. kubectl drain master --ignore-daemonsets
b. kubeadm upgrade apply v.1.12.0  (cluster component upgrade)
c. kubectl get nodes (you will still see older version as it is showing version of kubelet)
d. apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00 --allow-unauthenticated
e. systemctl restart kubelet

##worker
a. kubectl drain node01
b. pt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00 --allow-unauthenticated
c. apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00 --allow-unauthenticated
d. systemctl restart kubelet
